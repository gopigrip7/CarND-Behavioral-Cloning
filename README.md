# CarND-Behavioral-Cloning
## Project Overview
The Project is the third in Udacity SelfDriving CarND. The goal is to clone the human car driving behavior using DeepLearning Technique and replay it to drive (Only Steering) the car autonomously. For this Udacity has provided Simulator for recording the human driving behavior and an autonomous option to drive using the cloned behavior using deepLeanring.

##1 Quick start
###1.1 Prequest
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Pandas
- OpenCV3

###1.1
model.py - The script used to create and train the model.
drive.py - The script to drive the car. You can feel free to resubmit the original drive.py or make modifications and submit your modified version.
model.json - The model architecture.
model.h5 - The model weights.
README.md - explains the structure of your network and training approach. While we recommend using English for good practice, writing in any language is acceptable (reviewers will translate). There is no minimum word count so long as there are complete descriptions of the problems and the strategies. See the rubric for more details about the expectations.
